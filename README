cbacklight

I have an Acer C720 Chromebook for which xbacklight[1] doesn't work,
so I wrote an alternative. This was meant to be a chance to practice
Rust (in fact, I forgot I'd written the same thing in C[2] five years
ago). It uses a hardcoded backlight directory, though; the C version
guess at this.

It can be built and installed with

   make && sudo make install

which will install to /usr/local. It can also be built using

      cargo build [--release]

TODO:
  + read sysfs backlight directory to guess at the actual backlight
    files
  + improve the installer (DESTDIR, etc)
